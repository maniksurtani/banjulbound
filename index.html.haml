          What this is about?
        %p      
          Every year, resourceful and highly spirited adventure-loving kooks all over the world come together
          and form groups that will go on an epic voyage across Europe and West
          Africa. In a car worth just a few hundred pounds/euros they will drive
          from Plymouth, England to Banjul, the Gambia in pursuit of adventure, fortune, glory, 
          raising money for good causes and perhaps have a some fun
          encounters along the way that may involve lions. If (and that is a
          big IF) they manage to get across Europe and  through the rugged
          terrain of Africa without being eaten by lions, what is left of the
          car (after it survives the 3,700 mile/5,920 km journey) is flogged to
          the highest bidder in an auction in Banjul, with proceeds going to charity.
        %p

      Why are we doing this?
    %p
      Why did Mallory and Irvine attempt to climb Everest? Why did Amundsen
      and Scott race to the south pole? Why did Justin Esch and Dave Lefkow
      go beyond bacon-salt to invent 
      %a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baconnaise" target="_blank")Baconnaise?
      Because it was a damn cool thing to do and the result was awesome!
    %p
      Okay, more realistically, it's to raise money for
      %a(href="http://www.actionaid.org" target="_blank") ActionAid.

      %a{:href=>"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/donate/rebuild", :alt=>"ActionAid", :target=>"_NEW"}

    %p
      ActionAid is an international development charity working 
      with poor and marginalised people in over 40 countries worldwide.
      They focus on the people that others forget.
      People in poverty. People who face discrimination. People whose voices
      are ignored.  People who lack the rights we all take for granted.
      Simple things, like the right to eat. The right to stay on their land.
      To an education. To have a say in the decisions that shape their lives.
    %p
      We are dedicating our journey to the amazing work they do, and will be 
      visiting their operations in west Africa en-route.

      Our route
    Once we get started expect to see a dynamically updating map of where we are, thanks
    to geotagged tweets and Google Maps.  For now though, this is, approximately,
    what our intended route will be.
